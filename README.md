# About-Me

This web page provides a glimpse into my education background and the portfolios I have worked on.

The first page is an About Me page, which describes my educational background. I have used html, css and jquery on this page.
The page uses flexbox for its layout and the etstimonials are populated one by one using jquery and fading in and out the testimonials one by one.

# Porfolio
This page showcases all my projects using a carousel with fade-in / fade-out functionality. I have used flexbox for the page layout.
It also includes link to web pages hosted on github.

# Contact-Me
This includes a form which again uses jquery for validation and the form disappears on submission and re-appears when clicked on Contact link.
